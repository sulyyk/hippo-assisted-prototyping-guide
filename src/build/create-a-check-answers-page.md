# Check answers page

Before submitting, users should be able to review everything they have entered and change anything that is wrong. This is one of the most important patterns in GOV.UK service design – it prevents errors and builds user confidence.

The GOV.UK Design System calls this the [check answers pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/). It uses a summary list component to show each question and answer with a "Change" link next to each one.

## The prompt

In Gemini CLI, paste this prompt:

```
Create a GOV.UK check answers page at app/views/check-answers.html that extends layouts/main.html.

The page should have the heading "Check your answers" and show a summary list with three rows:
- Type of issue: Structural problem, with a change link back to /issue-type
- Floor or area: 2nd floor, with a change link back to /issue-location
- Description: There is a large crack in the exterior wall near the fire exit on the east side of the building., with a change link back to /issue-location

Each change link should include visually hidden text so screen reader users know what they are changing — for example "Change type of issue" rather than just "Change".

Below the summary list, add a heading "Now send your report" and the paragraph "By submitting this report you confirm the details are correct to the best of your knowledge."

Finally, add an "Accept and send" button that submits the form to /check-answers using a POST request.

Use GOV.UK Frontend components and classes throughout.
```

Gemini will show you the file it wants to create and ask for your permission. Use the **arrow keys** to select **Allow once**, then press **Enter** to confirm.

## Check your browser

Go to `http://localhost:3000/check-answers`.

<div class="inset-text">
<p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> You should see the heading "Check your answers", followed by a summary list showing three rows – each with a label on the left, the answer in the middle, and a "Change" link on the right. Below that, a paragraph and an "Accept and send" button.</p>
</div>

<details>
<summary>The summary list rows do not have a bottom border between them</summary>
<div class="details-body">
<p>The govuk-summary-list component adds borders automatically via CSS. If borders are missing, it may mean the GOV.UK Frontend stylesheet is not loading correctly, or the class names are wrong. Ask Gemini:</p>
<div class="code-block"><code>The summary list on app/views/check-answers.html is missing its row borders. Check that the govuk-summary-list, govuk-summary-list__row, govuk-summary-list__key, govuk-summary-list__value, and govuk-summary-list__actions classes are all present and correct.</code><button class="code-copy-btn" aria-label="Copy to clipboard">Copy</button></div>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>The "Change" links are not accessible</summary>
<div class="details-body">
<p>A "Change" link on its own is ambiguous for screen reader users – they cannot tell what they are changing. The GOV.UK pattern uses visually hidden text to add context. Each change link should look like this:</p>
<div class="code-block"><code>&lt;a href="/issue-type" class="govuk-link"&gt;Change&lt;span class="govuk-visually-hidden"&gt; type of issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code><button class="code-copy-btn" aria-label="Copy to clipboard">Copy</button></div>
<p>Sighted users see "Change". Screen reader users hear "Change type of issue". Ask Gemini to check all change links follow this pattern.</p>
</div>
</details>

## Understanding what Gemini built

<details>
<summary>Why the answers are hardcoded</summary>
<div class="details-body">
<p>In this prototype, the check answers page shows hardcoded answers – they are written directly into the HTML. A real service would pull the user's actual answers from the session (the server-side store of what the user entered). The Prototype Kit can do this using session data, but for a basic prototype the hardcoded values are enough to test the layout and flow with users.</p>
<p>If you want dynamic values from your form inputs, ask Gemini: <em>"Update app/views/check-answers.html to show the values from the session data, using {{ data['issue-type'] }}, {{ data['issue-floor'] }}, and {{ data['issue-description'] }}."</em></p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What govuk-visually-hidden does</summary>
<div class="details-body">
<p>The <code>govuk-visually-hidden</code> class hides text from sighted users but keeps it readable for screen readers. It uses a CSS technique that moves the element off-screen without using <code>display: none</code> (which would hide it from screen readers too). It is used whenever you need to add context that is already visually implied on screen – like change links, or icons that only make sense with a text label.</p>
